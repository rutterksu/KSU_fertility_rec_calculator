    "Create function(s) to automate the calculation of lime and fertilizer application rates based on soil test results from the KSRE Soil Testing Laboratory.\n",

    "## Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Input data consists of a combination of user inputs and soil measurements. Soil measurements include soil pH, buffer pH, organic matter, and plant available-P, -K, and -N will be imported as a csv file generated by the lab's data management system (SQL). Context parameters will be supplied by the user and include tillage practice, crop, and yield goal. Functions will be based on equations from KSU Fact Sheet MF-2586 and applied to these data. The output should be an excel file with 5 columns 'sampleID', 'lime_rate', 'N_rate', 'P2O5_rate', 'K2O_rate'.\n",
